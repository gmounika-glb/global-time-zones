# Time Zone App

A simple Time Zone App to display and manage clocks for various time zones. The app allows users to add multiple clocks, toggle between 12-hour and 24-hour formats, and switch between dark and light modes. Clocks and preferences are stored using localStorage, so they persist even after a page reload.

## Features:
- Add Clocks: Add clocks for different time zones.
- Time Format Toggle: Toggle between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
- Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- Timezone Dropdown: Select time zones from a dropdown list.
- Delete: Delete specific time.
- Keyboard Shortcuts:
  - Press 'Enter' to add a clock.
  - Press 'ctrl+r, cmd+r, shift+r' to reset all clocks.
  - Press 'ctrl+s, cmd+s, shift+s' to open the timezone dropdown.
  - Press 'ctrl+i, cmd+i, shift+i' to see the info.
  - Press 'ctrl+m, cmd+m, shift+m' to toggle the mode.

## Technologies:
- HTML: Structure and markup of the app.
- CSS: Basic styling (can be extended with external themes).
- JavaScript: Handles app functionality like adding clocks, storing preferences, and interacting with the UI.
- jQuery & Select2: Enhances the dropdown for selecting time zones.
