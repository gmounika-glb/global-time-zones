# Time Zone App

A simple Time Zone App to display and manage clocks for various time zones. The app allows users to add multiple clocks, toggle between 12-hour and 24-hour formats, and switch between dark and light modes. Clocks and preferences are stored using localStorage, so they persist even after a page reload.

## Features:
- Add Clocks: Add clocks for different time zones.
- Time Format Toggle: Toggle between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
- Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- Timezone Dropdown: Select time zones from a dropdown list.
- Keyboard Shortcuts:
  - Press 'i' to add a clock.
  - Press 'r' to reset all clocks.
  - Press 's' to open the timezone dropdown.

## Technologies:
- HTML: Structure and markup of the app.
- CSS: Basic styling (can be extended with external themes).
- JavaScript: Handles app functionality like adding clocks, storing preferences, and interacting with the UI.
- jQuery & Select2: Enhances the dropdown for selecting time zones.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   `bash
   git clone https://gmounika-glb.github.io/global-time-zones/
